### Introduction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses the API endpoints provided by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to present data on TV shows.

It is built to be responsive, utilizing Boostrap.

### Hosting
The project is hosted [here](http://tvshows.pappar.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com) on AWS.

### Basic features

- Search for TV shows by name
- Sort top TV shows by popularity or vote average based on their genre
- Present Information on each season

### Limitation
It is slow due to the time to make API calls. Improvement could be made through caching of data and employ server side rendering.
